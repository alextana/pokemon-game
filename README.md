# Pokemon Game
Super simple game built with the famous t3 stack (Typescript, NextJS, React, tRPC, Tailwind, Prisma, Railway)

This was mostly built as an exercise to test out technologies I have never used before, it was loads of fun and I will be definitely using this stack for my next projects.

Now I've got to think what to build next
